## Quick Start

1. Download repository to a machine with MATLAB installed.
2. Navigate to folder containing repository, and open `Code` folder.
3. Type `AnyElecConfig_RotatedNeurite` to run a simulation using 4 electrodes which displays the induced membrane potential for neurites at various locations and with various orientations (this generates a similar figure to Fig. 6 in the above paper).

### CellComp4Layer_Ve_f_Plane.m

*CellComp4Layer_Ve_f_Plane* returns the electric field in the Fourier domain due to epiretinal stimulation with point or disk electrodes in a plane in the x-z dimensions (where y is in the direction normal to the surface of the retina, toward the electrode). The retina is modelled using a 4-layer description, including Insulator, Vitreous, Nerve Fibre Layer, and the Ganglion Cell Layer (+ others). The insulator layer is modelled using a no-current boundary condition within the vitreous (see diagram below for geometry).
 
All units are S.I.

### CellComp3Layer_Ve_f_Plane.m

NOTE: Identical in implementation to CellComp3Layer_Ve_f_Plane but with a 3-layer model instead of 4, to simulate stimulation where no insulator is used.

*CellComp3Layer_Ve_f_Plane* returns the electric field in the Fourier domain due to epiretinal stimulation with point or disk electrodes in a plane in the x-z dimensions (where y is in the direction normal to the surface of the retina, toward the electrode). The retina is modelled using a 3-layer description, including Vitreous, Nerve Fibre Layer, and the Ganglion Cell Layer (+ others) (see diagram below for geometry).

### AnyElecConfig_RotatedNeurite.m

*AnyElecConfig_RotatedNeurite* simulates the epiretinal stimulation of retinal ganglion cell axons in the NFL (axons of passage) and in the ganglion cell layer (axon initial segments).

This script defines the:
  * Simulation numerics (i.e. spatial and temporal extent, sampling rates)
  * Geometry of the stimulating electrode(s)
  * Location and orientation of the simulated axons
  * Stimulation waveform (i.e. amplitude and phase duration for a biphasic pulse)

These parameters are then passed to the simulation function *CellComp4Layer_Ve_f_Plane* which performs the specified simulations (type "help CellComp4Layer_Ve_f_Plane" for more inforation). This script can also be used to call the 3-layer version, *CellComp3Layer_Ve_f_Plane*. *CellComp4Layer_Ve_f_Plane* and *CellComp3Layer_Ve_f_Plane* return the extracellular potential in the specified plane in the Fourier domain. In order to calculate the longitudinal and transverse components of the membrane potential, this script applies the supplied neurite equation (neur_eq) before calculating the inverse Fourier transform.

### SimulationParameters.m

*SimulationParameters* defines the simulation geometry and parameters for a
number of different simulations, and is called by *AnyElecConfig_RotatedNeurite*.

## Utilities

### NTESparams.m

*NTESPARAMS* returns the neurite dimensions and physiological parameters defined below. This function is called by the simulation scripts described above. Parameters can either be returned as double or single precision floats, using mode = 'double' and mode = 'single', respectively.

### Solve3LayerModelwInsulator.m

*Solve3LayerModelwInsulator* use MATLAB's symbolic mathematics toolbox to derive expressions for the integration coefficients used to solve the system of partial differential equations which define extracellular potential in the four layer model of the retina. See *CellComp4Layer_Ve_f_Plane* for an implementation of these coefficients.
